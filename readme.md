![LFO screen](fall2.png)

There are three LFOs. The LFO options include:

* Pulse width
* Attack
* Release
* Long delay time (quantized)
* Short delay time (quantized)

All the LFOs are off by default.

The LFOs are sine, square, sample and hold (random). To use the LFO menu, Enc 2 changes the selected option and Enc 3 changes the value. Key 3 toggles LFOs on and off.

### MIDI and other options

For MIDI and full control over all the parameters that drive the script, use Key 1 to go to the Norns menus then go to PARAMETERS, EDIT.
